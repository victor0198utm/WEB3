# Lab 3 - To-not-do app

## Story

Imagine, you're a frontend developer from Melbourne, Australia. You and your company Sleep2nigth Pty Ltd are working on a brand new product - To-not-do lists!

You've pitched the idea in the local startup accelerator, the jury has fallen in love with it and you've won first round of investitions. The only thing what's left - to build the app itself.

## Task

1. Copy [index.html](index.html), [style.css](style.css) and [app.js](app.js) to your repo;
2. Modify them to build an application for to-not-do list;
3. The app has to cover basic needs:
  - to add to the list;
  - to remove from the list;
  - to mark as not done;
  - see "not-done" and "to-not-do" lists separately (how?).

4. The app has to look attractive.

## Special conditions

You're not allowed to use any third-party library for JS, except utility functions such as `lodash` or `underscore`. `jquery` is not allowed.

## Grading

Points:

- basic app - `6` points
- attractive app - `+1` point
- the list is preserved after page refresh - `+1` point;

You can get `+2` points if the user can add images to their lists.
You can get `+1` point if the app uses fancy animation.
You can get `+1` point if the app has some other functions.

## Hints

- For UI, you are free to use any CSS library. You can try Tailwind CSS, or Bootstrap (why?);
- Use lastest standards of ECMAScript (2015 or later) to write JS code;
- To debug JS, put `debugger` somewhere in the code you want to check what's going wrong there;
- Use JS classes to separate business logic from data representation.
